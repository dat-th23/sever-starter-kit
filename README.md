# Backend Server Starter Kit with NodeJS/NestJS

## Introduction

This project provides a **standardized backend scaffold** built on the NestJS framework. It features clear modular architecture, designed for scalable, maintainable API and admin systems. The scaffold includes essential features such as authentication, user management, system logging, middleware, configuration, and utility services—ideal for both personal projects and team/enterprise usage.

## Core Features

- **Authentication (`auth/`)**: User registration & login, JWT-based authentication, user/admin role management
- **User Management (`users/`)**: CRUD operations for user accounts, user profiles, update information
- **Admin System (`admin/`)**: Admin dashboard, permissions/roles management, activity logs
- **Common Utilities (`utils/`)**: Utility functions, shared constants, reusable providers
- **Configuration (`config/`)**: Environment variables, database settings, secret keys management
- **Middleware (`middleware/`)**: Request logging, role/permission checks, global error handling
- **Logging System (`logs/`)**: System event logging, integration with advanced log libraries (Winston, Pino, etc.)

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- npm or Yarn
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose for consistent local environments

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd backend-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```
    npm install or yarn
    ```


3. **Set up environment variables**
- Copy the example file and fill in the values:
  ```
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- Edit `.env` for your custom PORT, DB_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.

4. **Start the server**
    ```
    npm run start:dev
    ```
- The API will run by default at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **API Documentation**
- Access Swagger docs at: `http://localhost:3000/api` (if enabled)

## Main Modules

| Module      | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| auth/       | Login, registration, JWT, authorization guards|
| users/      | User info management, update, search, delete  |
| admin/      | Dashboard, admin roles, permissions           |
| utils/      | Helpers, shared constants, reusable functions |
| config/     | Environment loading, global config            |
| middleware/ | Logging, auth checks, global error handling   |
| logs/       | Logging management, extending advanced logs   |

---

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS** (core framework)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **@nestjs/jwt** (JWT authentication)
- **@nestjs/config** (environment/config management)
- **ORM**: Ready to integrate TypeORM/Prisma (not enforced by default)
- **Winston/Pino** (advanced logging, optional)
- **Swagger** (API documentation)
- **Docker** (optional)

---

## Development & Extension

- Modular codebase: separate controller, service, DTO, entity for each module
- Supports unit & integration tests out of the box (NestJS best practices)
- Easily integrates with Docker for development databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
- Simple to extend with new modules (email, notifications, file upload, payments...)
